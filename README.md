# Declaration-2.0
This small project that includes Html, Css and JavaScript has the only function of making a declaration of love to your crush, the only thing it does is that when she positions her cursor on the "No" button she moves and just doesn't let her click. This version only has one difference with the previous one, and that is that it is much more beautiful, since it contains animations. MAY PRESENT ERRORS
